## Benefits

## Usage

The Vue Barcode Reader works out of the box by just including it.

### Using Video Camera

Once a stream from the users camera is loaded, it's displayed and continuously scanned for barcodes. Results are indicated by the decode event.

```js
import { StreamBarcodeReader } from "vue-barcode-reader";
```

In your template you can use this syntax:

```html
<StreamBarcodeReader @decode="onDecode" @loaded="onLoaded"></StreamBarcodeReader>
```

### Scanning from Image

The component renders to a simple file picker input element. Clicking opens a file dialog. On supporting mobile devices the camera is started to take a picture. The selected images are directly scanned and positive results are indicated by the `decode` event.

```js
import { ImageBarcodeReader } from "vue-barcode-reader";
```

In your template you can use this syntax:

```html
<ImageBarcodeReader @decode="onDecode" @error="onError"></ImageBarcodeReader>
```

```html
methods: { onDecode (result) { console.log(result) } }
```

## Events

The library emits the following events:

### loaded

When the library is loaded and the camera is ready to scan

### decode

When a barcode or QR code is scanned. The result is passed as a parameter to the event handler. The result is the text encoded in the barcode or QR code.

### result
